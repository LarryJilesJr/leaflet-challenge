# Leaflet Earthquake Visualization

Leaflet-challenge is a web application that visualizes earthquake data using 
Leaflet.js, a JavaScript library for interactive maps.

## Introduction

This project aims to provide an interactive visualization of recent earthquake 
data obtained from the USGS Earthquake Hazards Program. By plotting earthquake 
locations on a map and customizing the markers based on magnitude, users can 
explore and analyze seismic activity across different regions.

## Features

- Displays earthquake data as interactive markers on a map.
- Customizes marker size and color based on earthquake magnitude.
- Provides popup information for each earthquake marker, including location, magnitude, and depth.
- Supports toggling between different base map layers (e.g., street map, satellite view, topographic).
- Allows users to toggle earthquake data on and off for better visualization.
- Incorporates tectonic plate boundaries as an overlay layer to provide additional context.

## Data Sources

The earthquake data is sourced from the USGS Earthquake Hazards Program's GeoJSON feed, 
which provides information about earthquakes from the past 7 days. 
Tectonic plate boundaries data is sourced from the Tectonic Plates GeoJSON repository on GitHub.

## Technologies Used

- Leaflet.js: A JavaScript library for interactive maps.
- GeoJSON: A format for encoding a variety of geographic data structures.
- JavaScript: The primary programming language used for implementing the visualization.
- HTML/CSS: Markup and styling for the web application.

## Usage

To use this application:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Explore the interactive map to view recent earthquakes and tectonic plate 
boundaries.
4. Use the map controls to switch between different base map layers and toggle 
earthquake and Tectonic data on and off.

## Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome. If you have any suggestions, feature 
requests, or bug reports, please submit them as issues or pull requests on the 
GitHub repository.
